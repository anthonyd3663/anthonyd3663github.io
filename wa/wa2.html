    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Anthony Detweiler! I am a Electrical Engineer
        with a particular interest in <em>web development</em>. My pronouns
        are He/Him. My goals for this course, honestly, is to
        integrate the use of an Arduino with a webiste. I think 
        it would be so cool if I could pull this off.
