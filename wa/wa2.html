    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Anthony Detweiler! I am a Electrical Engineer
        <br>with a particular interest in <em>web development</em>. My pronouns
        <br>are He/Him. My goals for this course, honestly, is to
        <br>integrate the use of an Arduino with a webiste. I think 
        <br>it would be so cool if I could pull this off.

    <!--Note: why is \anthonyd3663github.io required
        for file path to work online, but it doesn't
        work on live server? Also, how to do I shorten
        my url?-->
