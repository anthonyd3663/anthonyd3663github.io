        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Ecuador,[a] officially the Republic of Ecuador,[b] is a country in northwestern South America, bordered
            by
            Colombia on the north, Peru on the east and south, and the Pacific Ocean on the west. Ecuador also
            includes
            the Galápagos Islands in the Pacific, about 1,000 kilometers (621 mi) west of the mainland. The
            country's
            capital is Quito and its largest city is Guayaquil. [20]
            <br>
            <br>
            The territories of modern-day Ecuador were once home to a variety of indigenous peoples that were
            gradually
            incorporated into the Inca Empire during the 15th century. The territory was colonized by Spanish Empire
            during the 16th century, achieving independence in 1820 as part of Gran Colombia, from which it emerged
            as a
            sovereign state in 1830. The legacy of both empires is reflected in Ecuador's ethnically diverse
            population,
            with most of its 17.8 million people being mestizos, followed by large minorities of Europeans, Native
            American, African, and Asian descendants. Spanish is the official language spoken by a majority of the
            population, although 13 native languages are also recognized, including Quechua and Shuar.
            <br>
            <br>
            Ecuador is a representative democratic presidential republic and a developing country[21] whose economy
            is
            highly dependent on exports of commodities, primarily petroleum and agricultural products. The country
            is a
            founding member of the United Nations, Organization of American States, Mercosur, PROSUR, and the
            Non-Aligned Movement. According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, between 2006 and 2016,
            poverty decreased from 36.7% to 22.5% and annual per capita GDP growth was 1.5 percent (as compared to
            0.6
            percent over the prior two decades). At the same time, the country's Gini index of economic inequality
            improved from 0.55 to 0.47.[22]
            <br>
            <br>
            One of 17 megadiverse countries in the world,[23][24] Ecuador hosts many endemic plants and animals,
            such as
            those of the Galápagos Islands. In recognition of its unique ecological heritage, the new constitution
            of
            2008 is the first in the world to recognize legally enforceable rights of nature.[25]

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Various peoples had settled in the area of future Ecuador before the arrival of the Incas. The
            archeological
            evidence suggests that the Paleo-Indians' first dispersal into the Americas occurred near the end of the
            last glacial period, around 16,500–13,000 years ago. The first people who reached Ecuador may have
            journeyed
            by land from North and Central America or by boat down the Pacific Ocean coastline.
            <br><br>
            Even though their languages were unrelated, these groups developed similar groups of cultures, each
            based in
            different environments. The people of the coast combined agriculture with fishing, hunting, and
            gathering;
            the people of the highland Andes developed a sedentary agricultural way of life; and peoples of the
            Amazon
            basin relied on hunting and gathering, in some cases combined with agriculture and arboriculture.
            <br><br>
            Many civilizations[27] arose in Ecuador, such as the Valdivia Culture and Machalilla Culture on the
            coast,[28][29] the Quitus (near present-day Quito),[30] and the Cañari (near present-day Cuenca).[31]
            <br><br>
            In the highland Andes mountains, where life was more sedentary, groups of tribes cooperated and formed
            villages; thus the first nations based on agricultural resources and the domestication of animals
            formed.
            Eventually, through wars and marriage alliances of their leaders, groups of nations formed
            confederations.
            <br><br>
            When the Incas arrived, they found that these confederations were so developed that it took the Incas
            two
            generations of rulers—Topa Inca Yupanqui and Huayna Capac—to absorb them into the Inca Empire. People
            belonging to the confederations that gave them the most problems were deported to distant areas of Peru,
            Bolivia, and north Argentina. Similarly, a number of loyal Inca subjects from Peru and Bolivia were
            brought
            to Ecuador to prevent rebellion. Thus, the region of highland Ecuador became part of the Inca Empire in
            1463
            sharing the same language.[32]
            <br><br>
            In contrast, when the Incas made incursions into coastal Ecuador and the eastern Amazon jungles of
            Ecuador,
            they found both the environment and indigenous people more hostile. Moreover, when the Incas tried to
            subdue
            them, these indigenous people withdrew to the interior and resorted to guerrilla tactics. As a result,
            Inca
            expansion into the Amazon Basin and the Pacific coast of Ecuador was hampered. The indigenous people of
            the
            Amazon jungle and coastal Ecuador remained relatively autonomous until the Spanish soldiers and
            missionaries
            arrived in force. The Amazonian people and the Cayapas of Coastal Ecuador were the only groups to resist
            both Inca and Spanish domination, maintaining their languages and cultures well into the 21st
            century.[33]
            <br><br>
            Before the arrival of the Spaniards, the Inca Empire was involved in a civil war. The untimely death of
            both
            the heir Ninan Cuyochi and the Emperor Huayna Capac, from a European disease that spread into Ecuador,
            created a power vacuum between two factions and led to a civil war.[34] The army stationed north[35][36]
            headed by Atahualpa marched south to Cuzco and massacred the royal family associated with his brother.
            In
            1532, a small band of Spaniards headed by Francisco Pizarro reached Cajamarca and lured Atahualpa into a
            trap (battle of Cajamarca). Pizarro promised to release Atahualpa if he made good his promise of filling
            a
            room full of gold. But, after a mock trial, the Spaniards executed Atahualpa by strangulation.[37]

            <h3>Spanish colonization</h3>
            <p>
                New infectious diseases such as smallpox, endemic to the Europeans, caused high fatalities among the
                Amerindian population during the first decades of Spanish rule, as they had no immunity. At the same
                time, the natives were forced into the encomienda labor system for the Spanish. In 1563, Quito
                became
                the seat of a real audiencia (administrative district) of Spain and part of the Viceroyalty of Peru
                and
                later the Viceroyalty of New Granada.
                <br><br>
                The 1797 Riobamba earthquake, which caused up to 40,000 casualties, was studied by Alexander von
                Humboldt, when he visited the area in 1801–1802.[38]
                <br><br>
                After nearly 300 years of Spanish rule, Quito still remained small with a population of 10,000
                people.
                On 10 August 1809, the city's criollos called for independence from Spain (first among the peoples
                of
                Latin America). They were led by Juan Pío Montúfar, Quiroga, Salinas, and Bishop Cuero y Caicedo.
                Quito's nickname, "Luz de América" ("Light of America"), is based on its leading role in trying to
                secure an independent, local government. Although the new government lasted no more than two months,
                it
                had important repercussions and was an inspiration for the independence movement of the rest of
                Spanish
                America. Today, 10 August is celebrated as Independence Day, a national holiday.[39]

            <h3>Independence</h3>
            <p>
                On 9 October 1820, the Department of Guayaquil became the first territory in Ecuador to gain its
                independence from Spain, and it spawned most of the Ecuadorian coastal provinces, establishing
                itself as
                an independent state. Its inhabitants celebrated what is now Ecuador's official Independence Day on
                24
                May 1822. The rest of Ecuador gained its independence after Antonio José de Sucre defeated the
                Spanish
                Royalist forces at the Battle of Pichincha, near Quito. Following the battle, Ecuador joined Simón
                Bolívar's Republic of Gran Colombia, also including modern-day Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama. In
                1830,
                Ecuador separated from Gran Colombia and became an independent republic. Two years later, it annexed
                the
                Galapagos Islands.[40]
                <br><br>
                The 19th century was marked by instability for Ecuador with a rapid succession of rulers. The first
                president of Ecuador was the Venezuelan-born Juan José Flores, who was ultimately deposed. Leaders
                who
                followed him included Vicente Rocafuerte; José Joaquín de Olmedo; José María Urbina; Diego Noboa;
                Pedro
                José de Arteta; Manuel de Ascásubi; and Flores's own son, Antonio Flores Jijón, among others. The
                conservative Gabriel García Moreno unified the country in the 1860s with the support of the Roman
                Catholic Church. In the late 19th century, world demand for cocoa tied the economy to commodity
                exports
                and led to migrations from the highlands to the agricultural frontier on the coast.
                <br><br>
                Ecuador abolished slavery in 1851.[41] The descendants of enslaved Ecuadorians are among today's
                Afro-Ecuadorian population.

            <h3>Liberal Revolution</h3>
            <p>
                The Liberal Revolution of 1895 under Eloy Alfaro reduced the power of the clergy and the
                conservative
                land
                owners. This liberal wing retained power until the military "Julian Revolution" of 1925. The 1930s
                and
                1940s
                were marked by instability and emergence of populist politicians, such as five-time President José
                María
                Velasco Ibarra.

            <h3>Loss of claimed territories since 1830</h3>
            <p>
                After Ecuador's separation from Colombia on 13 May 1830, its first President, General Juan José
                Flores,
                laid
                claim to the territory that had belonged to the Real Audiencia of Quito, also referred to as the
                Presidencia
                of Quito. He supported his claims with Spanish Royal decrees, or real cedulas, that delineated the
                borders
                of Spain's former overseas colonies. In the case of Ecuador, Flores based Ecuador's de jure claims
                on
                the
                Real Cedulas of 1563, 1739, and 1740; with modifications in the Amazon Basin and Andes Mountains
                that
                were
                introduced through the Treaty of Guayaquil (1829) which Peru reluctantly signed, after the
                overwhelmingly
                outnumbered Gran Colombian force led by Antonio José de Sucre defeated President and General La
                Mar's
                Peruvian invasion force in the Battle of Tarqui. In addition, Ecuador's eastern border with the
                Portuguese
                colony of Brazil in the Amazon Basin was modified before the Wars of Independence by the First
                Treaty of
                San
                Ildefonso (1777) between the Spanish Empire and the Portuguese Empire. Moreover, to add legitimacy
                to
                his
                claims, on 16 February 1840, Flores signed a treaty with Spain, whereby Flores convinced Spain to
                officially
                recognize Ecuadorian independence and its sole rights to colonial titles over Spain's former
                colonial
                territory known anciently to Spain as the Kingdom and Presidency of Quito.
                <br><br>
                Ecuador during its long and turbulent history has lost most of its contested territories to each of
                its
                more
                powerful neighbors, such as Colombia in 1832 and 1916, Brazil in 1904 through a series of peaceful
                treaties,
                and Peru after a short war in which the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro was signed in 1942.

            <h3>Return to democracy (1979–present)</h3>
            <p>
                Elections were held on 29 April 1979, under a new constitution. Jaime Roldós Aguilera was elected
                president, garnering over one million votes, the most in Ecuadorian history. He took office on 10
                August as the first constitutionally elected president, after nearly a decade of civilian and
                military dictatorships. In 1980, he founded the Partido Pueblo, Cambio y Democracia (People, Change,
                and Democracy Party) after withdrawing from the Concentración de Fuerzas Populares (Popular Forces
                Concentration). He governed until 24 May 1981, when he died, along with his wife and the minister of
                defense Marco Subia Martinez, when his Air Force plane crashed in heavy rain near the Peruvian
                border. Many people believe that he was assassinated by the CIA,[45] given the multiple death
                threats against him because of his reformist agenda, the deaths in automobile crashes of two key
                witnesses before they could testify during the investigation, and the sometimes contradictory
                accounts of the incident. Roldos was immediately succeeded by Vice President Osvaldo Hurtado.
                <br><br>
                In 1984 León Febres Cordero from the Social Christian Party was elected president. Rodrigo Borja
                Cevallos of the Democratic Left (Izquierda Democrática, or ID) party won the presidency in 1988,
                winning the runoff election against Abdalá Bucaram (brother in law of Jaime Roldos and founder of
                the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party). His government was committed to improving human rights protection
                and carried out some reforms, notably an opening of Ecuador to foreign trade. The Borja government
                negotiated the disbanding of the small terrorist group, "¡Alfaro Vive, Carajo!" ("Alfaro Lives,
                Dammit!"), named after Eloy Alfaro. However, continuing economic problems undermined the popularity
                of the ID party, and opposition parties gained control of Congress in 1999.

                A notable event was the Cenepa War fought between Ecuador and Peru in 1995.
                <br><br>
                Ecuador won its first Olympic medal in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta when Jefferson Pérez won
                gold in the 20 km walk.
                <br><br>
                Ecuador adopted the United States dollar on 13 April 2000 as its national currency and on 11
                September, the country eliminated the Ecuadorian sucre, in order to stabilize the country's
                economy.[46] The US Dollar has been the only official currency of Ecuador since then.[47]
                <br><br>
                The emergence of the Amerindian population as an active constituency has added to the democratic
                volatility of the country in recent years. The population has been motivated by government failures
                to deliver on promises of land reform, lower unemployment and provision of social services, and the
                historical exploitation by the land-holding elite. Their movement, along with the continuing
                destabilizing efforts by both the elite and leftist movements, has led to a deterioration of the
                executive office. The populace and the other branches of government give the president very little
                political capital, as illustrated by the most recent removal of President Lucio Gutiérrez from
                office by Congress in April 2005.[48] Vice President Alfredo Palacio took his place[49]
                <br><br>
                In the election of 2006, Rafael Correa gained the presidency.[50] In January 2007, several left-wing
                political leaders of Latin America, his future allies, attended his swearing-in ceremony.[51]
                Endorsed in a 2008 referendum, a new constitution implemented leftist reforms.[52] In December 2008,
                Correa declared Ecuador's national debt illegitimate, based on the argument that it was odious debt
                contracted by prior corrupt and despotic regimes. He announced that the country would default on
                over $3 billion worth of bonds, and he succeeded in reducing the price of outstanding bonds by more
                than 60% by fighting creditors in international courts.[53] He brought Ecuador into the Bolivarian
                Alliance for the Americas in June 2009. Correa's administration reduced the high levels of poverty
                and unemployment in Ecuador.[54][55][56][57][58]
                <br><br>
                Correa's three consecutive terms (from 2007 to 2017) were followed by his former Vice President
                Lenín Moreno's four years as president (2017–21). After being elected in 2017, President Moreno's
                government adopted economically liberal policies, such as reduction of public spending, trade
                liberalization, and flexibility of the labour code. Ecuador also left the left-wing Bolivarian
                Alliance for the Americas (Alba) in August 2018.[59] The Productive Development Act introduced an
                austerity policy, and reduced the previous development and redistribution policies. Regarding taxes,
                the authorities aimed to "encourage the return of investors" by granting amnesty to fraudsters and
                proposing measures to reduce tax rates for large companies. In addition, the government waived the
                right to tax increases in raw material prices and foreign exchange repatriations.[60] In October
                2018, Moreno cut diplomatic relations with the Maduro administration of Venezuela, a close ally of
                Correa.[61] The relations with the United States improved significantly under Moreno. In June 2019,
                Ecuador agreed to allow US military planes to operate from an airport on the Galapagos Islands.[62]
                In February 2020, his visit to Washington was the first meeting between an Ecuadorian and U.S.
                president in 17 years.[63]
                <br><br>
                A series of protests began on 3 October 2019 against the end of fuel subsidies and austerity
                measures adopted by Moreno. On 10 October, protesters overran Quito, the capital, causing the
                Government of Ecuador to relocate temporarily to Guayaquil.[64] The government eventually returned
                to Quito in 2019.[65] On 14 October 2019, the government restored fuel subsidies and withdrew an
                austerity package, which ended nearly two weeks of protests.[66]

                latter's inauguration in November 2023.
                In the 11 April 2021 election, conservative former banker Guillermo Lasso took 52.4% of the vote,
                compared to 47.6% for left-wing economist Andrés Aráuz, who was supported by exiled former president
                Correa. Lasso had finished second in the 2013 and 2017 presidential elections.[67] On 24 May 2021,
                Lasso was sworn in, becoming the country's first right-wing leader in 14 years.[68] Lasso's party
                CREO Movement, and its ally the Social Christian Party (PSC) won only 31 parliamentary seats out of
                137, while Aráuz's Union for Hope (UNES) won 49 seats, which meant Lasso needed support from the
                Izquierda Democrática and the indigenist Pachakutik parties to push through his legislative
                agenda.[69]
                <br><br>
                In October 2021, Lasso declared a 60-day state of emergency to combat crime and drug-related
                violence,[70] including the numerous bloody clashes between rival groups in the state prisons.[71]
                Lasso proposed a series of constitutional changes to enhance his government's ability to respond to
                crime. In a referendum in February 2023, voters overwhelmingly rejected his proposed changes, which
                weakened Lasso's political standing.[72]
                <br><br>
                On 15 October 2023, centrist candidate Daniel Noboa won the premature presidential election with
                52.3% of the vote against leftist candidate Luisa González.[73] On 23 November 2023, Noboa was sworn
                in.[74]
                <br><br>
                In January 2024, Noboa declared an "internal armed conflict" against organised crime, in response to
                the escape of imprisoned leader of the Los Choneros cartel, José Adolfo Macías Villamar (also known
                as "Fito"), and an armed attack at a public television channel.[75][76]

        <h2>Government and Politics</h2>
        <p>
            The Ecuadorian State consists of five branches of government: the Executive Branch, the Legislative Branch,
            the Judicial Branch, the Electoral Branch, and Transparency and Social Control.
            <br><br>
            Ecuador is governed by a democratically elected president for a four-year term. The president of Ecuador
            exercises his power from the presidential Palacio de Carondelet in Quito. The current constitution was
            written by the Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly elected in 2007, and was approved by referendum in 2008.
            Since 1936, voting is compulsory for all literate persons aged 18–65, optional for all other citizens over
            the age of 16.[77][78]
            <br><br>
            The executive branch includes 23 ministries. Provincial governors and councilors (mayors, aldermen, and
            parish boards) are directly elected. The National Assembly of Ecuador meets throughout the year except for
            recesses in July and December. There are thirteen permanent committees. Members of the National Court of
            Justice are appointed by the National Judicial Council for nine-year terms.

            <h3>Executive Branch</h3>
            <p>
                The executive branch is led by the president. The president is accompanied by the vice-president,
                elected for four years (with the ability to be re-elected only once). As head of state and chief
                government official, he is responsible for public administration including the appointing of national
                coordinators, ministers, ministers of State and public servants. The executive branch defines foreign
                policy, appoints the Chancellor of the Republic, as well as ambassadors and consuls, being the ultimate
                authority over the Armed Forces of Ecuador, National Police of Ecuador, and appointing authorities. The
                acting president's wife receives the title of First Lady of Ecuador.

        <p>
            The legislative branch is embodied by the National Assembly, which is headquartered in the city of Quito in
            the Legislative Palace, and consists of 137 assemblymen, divided into ten committees and elected for a
            four-year term. Fifteen national constituency elected assembly, two Assembly members elected from each
            province and one for every 100,000 inhabitants or fraction exceeding 150,000, according to the latest
            national population census. In addition, statute determines the election of assembly of regions and
            metropolitan districts.

        <p>
            Ecuador's judiciary has as its main body the Judicial Council, and also includes the National Court of
            Justice, provincial courts, and lower courts. Legal representation is made by the Judicial Council. The
            National Court of Justice is composed of 21 judges elected for a term of nine years. Judges are renewed by
            thirds every three years pursuant to the Judicial Code. These are elected by the Judicial Council on the
            basis of opposition proceedings and merits. The justice system is buttressed by the independent offices of
            public prosecutor and the public defender. Auxiliary organs are as follows: notaries, court auctioneers, and
            court receivers. Also there is a special legal regime for Amerindians.

            The electoral system functions by authorities which enter only every four years or when elections or
            referendums occur. Its main functions are to organize, control elections, and punish the infringement of
            electoral rules. Its main body is the National Electoral Council, which is based in the city of Quito, and
            consists of seven members of the political parties most voted, enjoying complete financial and
            administrative autonomy. This body, along with the electoral court, forms the Electoral Branch which is one
            of Ecuador's five branches of government.

    <!-- Section 4: Geography -->
    <div id="S4.0.0">
        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>
            According to the CIA, Ecuador has a total area of 283,571 km2 (109,487 sq mi), including the Galápagos
            Islands. Of this, 276,841 km2 (106,889 sq mi) is land and 6,720 km2 (2,595 sq mi) water.[2] The total area,
            according to the Ecuadorian government's foreign ministry, is 256,370 km2 (98,985 sq mi).[96] The Galápagos
            Islands are sometimes considered part of Oceania,[97][98][99][100][101][102][103] which would thus make
            Ecuador a transcontinental country under certain definitions. Ecuador is bigger than Uruguay, Suriname,
            Guyana and French Guiana in South America.
            <br><br>
            Ecuador lies between latitudes 2°N and 5°S, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and has 2,337 km
            (1,452 mi) of coastline. It has 2,010 km (1,250 mi) of land boundaries, with Colombia in the north (with a
            590 km (367 mi) border) and Peru in the east and south (with a 1,420 km (882 mi) border). It is the
            westernmost country that lies on the equator.[104]
            <br><br>
            The country has four main geographic regions:
            <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>La Costa</em>, or "the coast": The coastal region consists of the provinces to the west of the
                Andean range –
                Esmeraldas, Guayas, Los Ríos, Manabí, El Oro, Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas and Santa Elena. It is the
                country's most fertile and productive land, and is the seat of the large banana exportation plantations
                of
                the companies Dole and Chiquita. This region is also where most of Ecuador's rice crop is grown. The
                truly
                coastal provinces have active fisheries. The largest coastal city is Guayaquil.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>La Sierra</em>, or "the highlands": The sierra consists of the Andean and Interandean highland
                provinces – Azuay,
                Cañar, Carchi, Chimborazo, Imbabura, Loja, Pichincha, Bolívar, Cotopaxi and Tungurahua. This land
                contains
                most of Ecuador's volcanoes and all of its snow-capped peaks. Agriculture is focused on the traditional
                crops of potato, maize, and quinua and the population is predominantly Amerindian Kichua. The largest
                Sierran city is Quito.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>La Amazonía</em>, also known as El Oriente, or "the east": The oriente consists of the Amazon jungle
                provinces –
                Morona Santiago, Napo, Orellana, Pastaza, Sucumbíos, and Zamora-Chinchipe. This region is primarily made
                up
                of the huge Amazon national parks and Amerindian untouchable zones, which are vast stretches of land set
                aside for the Amazon Amerindian tribes to continue living traditionally. It is also the area with the
                largest reserves of petroleum in Ecuador, and parts of the upper Amazon here have been extensively
                exploited
                by petroleum companies. The population is primarily mixed Amerindian Shuar, Waorani and Kichua, although
                there are numerous tribes in the deep jungle which are little-contacted. The largest city in the Oriente
                Lago Agrio in Sucumbíos.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>La Región Insular</em> is the region comprising the Galápagos Islands, some 1,000 kilometers (620
                mi) west of the
                mainland in the Pacific Ocean.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Ecuador's capital and second largest city[contradictory] is Quito,[105] which is in the province of
            Pichincha in the Sierra region. It is the second-highest capital city with an elevation of 2,850 meters.
            Ecuador's largest city[contradictory] is Guayaquil,[106] in the Guayas Province. Cotopaxi, just south of
            Quito, is one of the world's highest active volcanoes. The top of Mount Chimborazo (6,268 m, or 20,560 ft,
            above sea level), Ecuador's tallest mountain, is the most distant point from the center of the Earth on the
            Earth's surface because of the ellipsoid shape of the planet.[2] The Andes is the watershed divisor between
            the Amazon watershed, which runs to the east, and the Pacific, including the north–south rivers Mataje,
            Santiago, Esmeraldas, Chone, Guayas, Jubones, and Puyango-Tumbes.
        </p>
        <div id="S4.1.0">
            <h3>Climate</h3>
            <p>
                There is great variety in the climate, largely determined by altitude. It is mild year-round in the
                mountain valleys, with a humid subtropical climate in coastal areas and rainforest in lowlands. The
                Pacific coastal area has a tropical climate with a severe rainy season. The climate in the Andean
                highlands is temperate and relatively dry, and the Amazon basin on the eastern side of the mountains
                shares the climate of other rainforest zones.
                <br><br>
                Because of its location at the equator, Ecuador experiences little variation in daylight hours during
                the course of a year. Both sunrise and sunset occur each day at the two six o'clock hours.[2]
                <br><br>
                The country has seen its seven glaciers lose 54.4% of their surface in forty years. Research predicts
                their disappearance by 2100. The cause is climate change, which threatens both the fauna and flora and
                the population.[107]
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="S4.2.0">
            <h3>Biodiversity</h3>
            <p>
                Ecuador is one of seventeen megadiverse countries in the world according to Conservation
                International,[23] and it has the most biodiversity per square kilometer of any nation.[108][109]
                <br><br>
                Ecuador has 1,600 bird species (15% of the world's known bird species) in the continental area and 38
                more endemic in the Galápagos. In addition to more than 16,000 species of plants, the country has 106
                endemic reptiles, 138 endemic amphibians, and 6,000 species of butterfly. The Galápagos Islands are well
                known as a region of distinct fauna, as the famous place of birth to Darwin's Theory of Evolution, and
                as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[110]
                <br><br>
                Ecuador has the first constitution to recognize the rights of nature.[111] The protection of the
                nation's biodiversity is an explicit national priority as stated in the National Plan of "Buen Vivir",
                or good living, Objective 4, "Guarantee the rights of nature", Policy 1: "Sustainably conserve and
                manage the natural heritage, including its land and marine biodiversity, which is considered a strategic
                sector".[108]
                <br><br>
                Western Santa Cruz tortoise in the Galápagos Islands
                As of the writing of the plan in 2008, 19% of Ecuador's land area was in a protected area; however, the
                plan also states that 32% of the land must be protected in order to truly preserve the nation's
                biodiversity.[108] Current protected areas include 11 national parks, 10 wildlife refuges, 9 ecological
                reserves, and other areas.[112] A program begun in 2008, Sociobosque, is preserving another 2.3% of
                total land area (6,295 km2, or 629,500 ha) by paying private landowners or community landowners (such as
                Amerindian tribes) incentives to maintain their land as native ecosystems such as native forests or
                grasslands. Eligibility and subsidy rates for this program are determined based on the poverty in the
                region, the number of hectares that will be protected, and the type of ecosystem of the land to be
                protected, among other factors.[113] Ecuador had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of
                7.66/10, ranking it 35th globally out of 172 countries.[114]
                <br><br>
                Despite being on the UNESCO list, the Galápagos are endangered by a range of negative environmental
                effects, threatening the existence of this exotic ecosystem.[115] Additionally, oil exploitation of the
                Amazon rainforest has led to the release of billions of gallons of untreated wastes, gas, and crude oil
                into the environment,[116] contaminating ecosystems and causing detrimental health effects to Amerindian
                peoples.[117][118] One of the best known examples is the Texaco-Chevron case.[119] This American oil
                company operated in the Ecuadorian Amazon region between 1964 and 1992. During this period, Texaco
                drilled 339 wells in 15 petroleum fields and abandoned 627 toxic wastewater pits. It is now known that
                these highly polluting and now obsolete technologies were used as a way to reduce expenses.[120]
                <br><br>
                In 2022 the supreme court of Ecuador decided that "under no circumstances can a project be carried out
                that generates excessive sacrifices to the collective rights of communities and nature." It also
                required the government to respect the opinion of Indigenous peoples about different industrial projects
                on their land.[121]
